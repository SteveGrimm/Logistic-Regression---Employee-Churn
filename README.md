# Logistic Regression - Employee Churn

Building a Logistic Regression Model to predict whether company employees were likely to churn or not, including client presentation. 

The Model includes the use of:

* StandardScaler
* GridSearchCV
* PipeLine

and the following libraries:

* SKLearn (Logistic Regression)
* Seaborn (Visualization)

My Model was able to correctly identify churning employees **75%** of the time.
